# Eaton Wedding

I made this site in 2007-08 for our wedding. It was originally a PHP/MySQL site. In 2017, I converted it to a static site.

This was one of the first sites I made from scratch. This is why I didn't want to trust the PHP code anymore. ðŸ˜„

My favorite part was the online RSVP. I even had running stats as RSVPs came in.
